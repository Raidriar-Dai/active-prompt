        "Q": "At the gym, Hillary swims every 6 days, runs every 4 days and cycles every 16 days. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?",
        "A": " To calculate in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day, we need to find the least common multiple of 6, 4, and 16. The least common multiple of 6, 4, and 16 is 6*4*16 = 384. So she will do all three activities again on the same day in 384 days."

        "Q": "David spent 74 cents. He bought a ruler for 29 cents and a folder for 25 cents. He also bought 2 pencils. How much does one pencil cost?",
        "A": " To calculate how much does one pencil cost, we need to know the total amount of money David spent, the amount of money spent on the ruler, the amount of money spent on the folder, and the number of pencils bought. The total amount of money David spent is 74 cents. The amount of money spent on the ruler is 29 cents. The amount of money spent on the folder is 25 cents. The number of pencils bought is 2. Therefore, the amount of money spent on the pencils is 74 - 29 - 25 = 20 cents. So, one pencil cost 20/2 = 10 cents. The answer is 10."

        "A": " To calculate how many pieces of clothing could Paige's dresser hold if she had 4 drawers, we need to know the number of pieces of clothing each drawer could hold and the total number of drawers she has. Each drawer could hold 2 pieces of clothing, and she has 4 drawers. So the total number of pieces of clothing her dresser could hold is 2 * 4 = 8 pieces of clothing. The answer is 8."
